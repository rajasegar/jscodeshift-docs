# jscodeshift-docs
A Reference Guide for writing JS Codemods

The reason this project is created is because, I simply frustrated for looking up 
reference for writing codemods and the jscodeshift api is not very well documented.

The intention is to catch all the api reference in one place so that it will be
easy to write codemods.

## APIs 

- [/babel-core.md](babel-core)
